  PomBase gene characterisation status:
    - name: published
      definition: >
        Characterised, or partially characterised in a small scale experiment. 
        Some published information about the biological role (process).
        "biological role" here refers to  assigned to a biological process GO 
        slim term, or more specific
        http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/GO_slim.html
        excluding response to stress, cellular homeostasis, phosphate metabolic 
        process are "non-specific" process terms.
    - name: biological role inferred
      definition: >
        The biological role is inferred from homology to a characterised 
        sequence orphan.
        "biological role" here refers to  assigned to a biological process GO 
        slim term, or more specific
        http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/GO_slim.html
        excluding response to stress, cellular homeostasis, phosphate metabolic 
        process are "non-specific" process terms.
    - name: conserved unknown
      definition: >
        conserved outside the Schizosacchaomyces, but nothing known about the 
        biological role in any organism.
        "biological role" here refers to  assigned to a biological process GO 
        slim term, or more specific

        excluding response to stress, cellular homeostasis, phosphate metabolic 
        process are "non-specific" process terms.
    - name: sequence orphan
      definition: >
        unpublished fission yeast  specific (S. pombe or S. octospurus or S. 
        japonicus)  but nothing known about biological role
    - name: fission yeast specific family
      definition: >
        unpublished fission yeast (pombe or octospurus or japonicus)  specific 
        but nothing known about biological role, but  are  not single copy 
        (duplications  in fission yeast)
    - name: dubious
      definition: Unlikely to be coding
    - name: transposon
      definition: >
        A transposon or insertion sequence. An element that can insert
        in a variety of DNA sequences.
