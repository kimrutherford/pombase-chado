  PomBase gene characterisation status:
    - name: published
      definition: >
        A gene product characterised, or partially characterised in a small
        scale experiment to providing published information about the biological
        process. The biological process annotation must be equivalent to, or
        more specific than terms in the "GO slim"
        http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/GO_slim.html
    - name: biological role inferred
      definition: >
        A gene product whose biological process is inferred from homology to an
        experimentally characterised gene product.  The biological process
        annotation must be equivalent to, or more specific than terms in the "GO
        slim"  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/GO_slim.html
    - name: conserved unknown
      definition: >
        A gene product which is conserved more broadly than the
        Schizosacchaomyces clade,  but cannot be assigned a biological process
        term,  equivalent to, or more specific than the terms in the "GO slim"
        http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/GO_slim.html based on
        experimental data from any organism
    - name: sequence orphan
      definition: >
        A gene product which is not conserved outside the Schizosacchaomyces clade
        and where nothing is published about, or can be inferred from homology
        about the biological role
    - name: fission yeast specific family
      definition: >
        A gene product which is not conserved outside the Schizosacchaomyces clade
        and where nothing is published about, or can be inferred from homology
        about the biological role
        but are present in more than one copy in fission yeast
    - name: dubious
      definition: Unlikely to be coding
    - name: transposon
      definition: >
        A transposon or insertion sequence. An element that can insert
        in a variety of DNA sequences.
